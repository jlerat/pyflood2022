It made landfall at night between Kowanyama,and Pormpuraaw on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, as a weak category one system with winds up to 100 km per hour. The following morning, as the cyclone moved inland it was downgraded to a tropical low system. The low moved toward the east coast, near Cooktown on 23 January and then tracked slowly to the south-south-east just inland from the coast, impacting areas near Townsville on 24 January. The weather system stalled over the St. Lawrence-Rockhampton area on the 25th and 26th, and then tracked south to near Dalby west of Brisbane on the 28th, finally accelerating in a southerly direction eventually moving offshore south of Sydney on 29 January...The ex-tropical cyclone brought with it a heavy monsoonal rainfall system that lasted for approximately one week. Most of the eastern areas of Queensland, and the coast of New South Wales ending in the Wollongong area experienced very heavy rainfall during the period from 22 to 29 January 2013.

Winds reached 131 km per hour at Cape Byron. Mt Crosby water treatment plant was shut down owing to turbidity in the Brisbane River. Water was released from the Wivenhoe dam from 91per cent to 88 per cent to cope with flood waters. Water was also released from North Pine Dam and Somerset Dam...Torrential rainfall and flooding also occurred in northern New South Wales particularly near Lismore and Grafton where approximately 2000 evacuations occurred.

The Burnett river was running at approximately 70 km per hour and threatening houses. Despite a mandatory evacuation order issued to 5000 residents, an emergency airlift was the only option for some stranded residents. Eighteen helicopters were utilised in a rescue effort evacuating more than 1000 people trapped by flood waters in North Bundaberg and other most-at-risk areas to at least nine evacuation centres which was a record evacuation effort in Australia. The Bundaberg hospital was also evacuated and approximately 130 patients were transferred to hospitals in Brisbane...On 31 January, in North Bundaberg, approximately 7000 residents were forced out of their homes and not allowed to return until they were checked and declared safe. Defence personnel, 180 in total, went house to house within an exclusion zone, conducting search and rescue operations. Defence personnel also helped to repair damaged infrastructure and clean people's homes as part of the initial recovery operation...Financial assistance and grants were made available to eligible Queensland flood victims, including:..Queensland Floods Appeal 2013 payments.Emergent Assistance Grant.Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP).Essential Services Safety and Reconnection Grant..The Queensland government also provided financial help and support services to business owners and primary producers such as low interest loans and clean up and recovery grants. Other assistance included freight subsidies, Individual Disaster Stricken Property (IDSP) declarations and leasehold rent relief...The Federal Attorney-General announced flood and storm victims, employees, small business persons and farmers could apply for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments:..New South Wales payments totalled $17,100,000.Queensland payments totalled $140,270,000. ..Natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements were provided as a joint commonwealth and state / territory government initiative for local government areas...The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the January 2013 damage at $121 million for New South Wales and $977 million for Queensland.","ABC News, ‘Blanket of mud revealed in Rockhampton’, 5 February 2013, website viewed 7 February 2013

Rainfall peaked in Tully where approximately 1,000 mm (39 in) of rain fell, with 632 mm (24.9 in) falling over a 48 hour span. The township of Scherger received a record-breaking 370 mm (15 in) in just 24 hours. These rains caused widespread flooding in the state that shut down many roads and isolated communities. The town of Ingham was completely cut off due to high waters. Residents in the town were advised to stock up on emergency supplies as the Herbert River rose rapidly after 200 mm (7.9 in) of rain fell in the town in just three hours. In Cairns, winds up to 90 km/h (56 mph) left many homes without power and waves up to 4 m (13 ft) prompted the cancellation of most coastal activities.

Strong winds, heavy rainfall and floods battered several population centres, including Rockhampton, Biloela, Yeppoon, Byfield, Marmor, Monto, Jambin and parts of the Callide Valley...Twelve Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements were activated across 14 regions of Queensland, comprising $13.77 million in financial assistance provided to affected community members. Near 2,000 properties were damaged. The Insurance Council of Australia estimated insured damage to the figure of $403.6 million...Timeline.The tropical low that eventually became severe tropical cyclone Marcia was first identified and tracked on 15 February 2015, observed on the monsoon trough southeast of Papua New Guinea in the Coral Sea. On 18 February, after several days of drifting eastward with little change, the system turned southwest and began intensifying. The system was officially designated a Category 1 cyclone that evening, subsequently undergoing rapid intensification to a Category 4 in approximately ten hours. By 20 February, Cyclone Marcia had intensified to a Category 5; crossing the Queensland coast at Shoalwater Bay at 8:00am, 90 kilometres north-north-west of Yeppoon. ..As the cyclone passed to the east, Middle Percy Island experienced wind gusts of 208 kilometres per hour, with a maximum recorded speed of 295 kilometres per hour.

TC Debbie was forecast to increase rapidly in intensity before making landfall on the Queensland coast; this prediction was borne out as TC Debbie made landfall as a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone near Airlie Beach on 28 March 2017...From Airlie Beach TC Debbie tracked inland on a south-westerly track, losing tropical cyclone intensity at about 3.00am on 29 June. Ex-TC Debbie continued south, turning onto a south-easterly track and passing over the coast of northern New South Wales and out to sea on the 31 March...The impacts of TC Debbie were twofold. Storm damage resulted from both the high winds associated with the cyclone, and the very heavy rain that came in the wake of Debbie’s track. The highest wind gust recorded in Queensland in recent times, at 263 kilometres per hour, was noted at Hamilton Island as TC Debbie passed over, and damage occurred throughout the Whitsundays, in coastal towns such as Proserpine and Bowen, and inland to Collinsville...Significant fire and emergency service resources were mobilised to support operations following on the impact of TC Debbie, both from the affected states and interstate. Personnel from South Australia, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania were involved; New South Wales resources deployed into Queensland as well as operating in their home state. Sadly, at least ten fatalities resulted from the flooding and severe weather associated with TC Debbie, and hundreds of dwellings were severely damaged by the impacts of high winds and inundation...Associated rain and flooding..Observed rainfall totals included:..29 March 2017..Greenmount and Dumbleton Rocks on the Pioneer River – 92 millimetres in 60 minutes.30 March 2017..Beaudesert – 156 millimetres in six hours.O'Reillys – 90 millimetres in six hours.Rathdowney – 118 millimetres in six hours.Round Mountain – 119 millimetres in six hours.Rudds Lane (on the Logan-Albert River) – 148 millimetres in six hours.31 March 2017..Lismore, New South Wales – 324.8 millimetres in the 18 hours to 3.00am – wettest March day in over 100 years of record.Tweed River catchment – average of 374.1 millimetres – wettest day on record for any month.Significant riverine flooding ensued in a number of catchments including the Condamine, Burnett, Fitzroy, Logan, and Tweed Rivers.

Marcus reached Category 2 status in the hours before it crossed the Northern Territory coastline on Saturday 17 March; it passed directly over Darwin just before midday, an hour earlier than originally estimated. Wind gusts of 130 kilometres per hour were recorded in Darwin, and a new March record of 126 kilometres per hour was recorded at Darwin Airport...With winds easing, the city’s cyclone shelters closed by about 8.00pm and residents were sent home. That evening however, Northern Territory Emergency Service (NTES) staff worked through around 400 incidents across the region...Marcus eased to a Category 1 cyclone; by the evening of the following day, heavy rain over the Top End started to abate...However, as it passed over Western Australia’s northern Kimberley, Marcus again intensified to Category 2. People in or near coastal and island communities from Wyndham to Mitchell Plateau, Beagle Bay and Cockatoo Island were warned to prepare for the approaching storm...Marcus intensified rapidly after it passed over the northern Kimberley and moved west into open waters, reaching Category 5 over the Indian Ocean on 21 March – the most intense tropical cyclone in the Australian region since severe tropical cyclone Monica in 2006. Marcus then weakened rapidly as it moved south and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 25 March...Marcus was the strongest tropical cyclone to hit Darwin since severe tropical cyclone Tracy (Category 4) in December 1974. Marcus caused the cancellation of major events and all flights in and out of Darwin. Approximately 26,000 homes were affected by electricity outages due to destructive winds, in areas as far south as Batchelor and Adelaide River. Thousands of residents in the greater Darwin area were warned to boil water before drinking it. Thousands of trees were destroyed across Darwin, including many shallowrooted African mahoganies planted after Tracy...Public schools and non-essential public service agencies were closed, some for several days, while clean-up efforts continued. Removing downed trees and power lines from roads was a priority. The city’s water supply was affected; residents were urged for nearly 48 hours to boil tap water before using it. The Health Department issued a warning for melioidosis, a life-threatening disease spread by contact with soil, mud and surface water...The clean-up in Darwin was coordinated by the NTES and included more than 200 City of Darwin staff. Through Defence Assistance to Civil Community (DACC) arrangements, One Brigade Emergency Response Force assisted with tree clearance in public premises and an Australian Defence Force Joint Task Force assisted with general street clearance. The defence deployment included United States Marine Corps troops based in Darwin...While there were over 6,400 insurance claims, and insurance costs topped A$75 million, Marcus caused no fatalities. And unlike Tracy, Marcus caused relatively little structural damage; in part due to less severe winds as well as improved building codes for cyclone conditions established after Tracy. The Insurance Council of Australia reported that most claims were for damage caused by falling trees.","This incident was included in the Major Incidents Report 2017-18 (Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience, 2018).

The daily totals of 236.2 millimetres at kunanyi/Mount Wellington and 226.4 millimetres at Leslie Vale were second and third highest on the list of the top three highest May daily rainfalls ever recorded in Tasmania (behind 258 millimetres at Gray on 18 May 1986)...Much of the rain fell in about six hours on the Thursday evening, leading to flash flooding in many streams in southeast Tasmania. The very heavy rain was caused by a highly active line of thunderstorms that traversed Hobart over a number of hours, with each thunderstorm following a similar path as it moved in from the east...Hobart recorded 128 millimetres, with a third of that falling in one hour between 10.00pm and 11.00pm on the Thursday evening. Flash flooding affected parts of Hobart’s central business district, Salamanca, South Hobart, Sandy Bay, New Town, Blackmans Bay and Kingston. The Hobart Rivulet broke its banks, and several cars in adjacent streets in South Hobart and near the Hobart waterfront were swept away...The event had an annual exceedance probability of less than one per cent and caused extensive damage to bridges, roads, buildings and other infrastructure...More than 13,000 homes lost electricity, more than 30 schools were closed and a few homes in Sandy Bay lost their roofs as winds lashed the city. Emergency services received hundreds of calls for assistance, with State Emergency Service crews responding to more than 280 calls. Electricity supplies were re-established to most affected suburbs by late the following day...Evacuation centres were established at Mathers House in the city and at Kingston for people requiring shelter, information and support...Several roads were closed in the greater Hobart region overnight due to landslips, with council crews clearing rocks and dirt from roadways. While flights continued to operate out of Hobart Airport, there were some delays as ground staff were unable to get to work...On 14 May, the Australian Government declared the floods a disaster, enabling relief funds to be available for those affected...The Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) declared the floods a catastrophe, ensuring that claims by those affected were given priority. By late August, ICA reported that almost 8,800 claims had been lodged, with private property claims exceeding $99.7 million and public infrastructure claims exceeding $37 million – bringing the total damage bill to more than $137 million...Hobart City’s damage bill remained at $20 million, and Kingborough Council expected losses to exceed $2 million.

Maximum sustained winds were 195 kilometres per hour, with a peak wind gust of 275 kilometres per hour...Veronica brought very destructive gusts of more than 200 kilometres per hour as it tracked westward along the coast towards Karratha before weakening to a category 2 system the following day. The cyclone continued westward and was finally downgraded to a tropical low to the west of Karratha on the 26 March and passed Exmouth on 27 March. Veronica produced rainfall totals along the Pilbara coast and adjacent inland areas between Port Hedland and Karratha that were five to seven times the March average. A number of sites had their wettest March on record or wettest March since 1988...As a result of the community’s preparedness, no deaths or significant injuries were reported...The port of Port Hedland, one of the largest iron ore loading ports in the world, was closed for nearly 5 days from 22 March due to Veronica. BHP’s iron ore production was reduced by an estimated 6–8 million tonnes, Rio Tinto’s by approximately 14 million tonnes, and Fortescue Metals’ production by an estimated 2 million tonnes...Estimated Commonwealth–State Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements claims for this event were $36.7 million across the three LGAs, with the majority deriving from the Town of Port Hedland and City of Karratha for the restoration of essential public assets.","This incident was included in the Major Incidents Report 2018-19 (Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience, 2019).

River level rises in these catchments caused flooding at several townships downstream, including heavily populated areas around Logan City, Warwick, Dalby, Chinchilla, Tewantin and Gympie...Some of the heaviest rainfall was experienced at Coolangatta, which on Saturday 8 February recorded 201 millimetres (mm) in 24 hours...The Bureau of Meteorology (the Bureau) reported that severe thunderstorms had also created intense downpours around Warwick, 140 kilometres west of the Gold Coast, with more than 80mm falling in an hour and providing some relief from drought conditions. The town received more than two years of water supply from the downpours, with water flowing into the nearby Leslie Dam...While several other areas received more than 200mm of rain in the same 24 hours, no records were broken. The Gold Coast and Stradbroke Island were the most affected that day, and the Darling Downs experienced totals exceeding 100mm...The following day, the Bureau issued a severe storm warning for several parts of south-east Queensland. Later that day, two people had to be rescued from a car in floodwaters at Greenmount, south of Toowoomba, and about ten homes were evacuated in Jondaryan, a few kilometres to the north-west...The State Emergency Service (SES) received hundreds of requests for assistance (RFAs), most commonly for flood-affected properties and damage to roofs.  The busiest LGAs in the south-east were Brisbane (210 RFAs), Gold Coast City (151), Redland City (100), Logan City (96) and Moreton Bay Regional (62). Between Friday night on 7 Feb and the following Monday morning, the Fire and Rescue Service carried out 32 swift-water rescues across the region...By Monday 10 February, the widespread storms and heavy rain had flooded many parts of south-east Queensland and the Darling Downs. Heavy rain had hit parts of Brisbane (220mm), with numerous cars parked in streets now underwater, and several roads and train lines had been cut by floodwaters. Trains on the Ipswich/Rosewood line were suspended between Wacol and Gailes stations in both directions due to flooding of the rail line. Brisbane suburbs including Pullenvale, Kenmore, Woolloongabba, Moorooka, Holland Park, Tarragindi and Durack all experienced flash flooding...On 11 February severe flooding affected parts of the Western Downs region, with warnings issued for Dalby where the Myall Creek broke its banks, and for Jandowae and Warra, where the Jandowae Creek overflowed. Myall Creek peaked at 3.2m and caused widespread flooding in Dalby...Several parts of the Sunshine and Gold Coast areas recorded more than 170mm of rain in 24 hours to 13 February. Marcoola recorded 232mm of rain during this period, Nambour 201mm and Southport 177mm. In both areas, heavy rain continued to fall: in the 24 hours to 9.00am on Thursday, the northern Gold Coast experienced between 100mm-200mm of rainfall. Ten schools and 18 early childhood centres were closed on the Gold Coast on the Thursday, as well as all Gold Coast beaches and most of the region's theme parks. That same day, a nursing home at Mt Coolum on the Sunshine Coast was evacuated due to concerns about flooding...Sadly, a 75 year-old kayaker was found dead on the Sunshine Coast after going onto the Mary River in the Sunshine Coast hinterland the previous Sunday. The man’s body was found just after 10.30am on Thursday, near Cooks Road at Conondale...On 10 February, the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) declared the storms and associated flooding a catastrophe, enabling claims to be processed quickly. On 28 May 2020, the ICA reported that 96,594 claims for homes and businesses damaged by the storms had been lodged in south-east QLD and eastern New South Wales, with estimated combined insurance losses of $896 million. Most claims were for property damage caused by storm runoff, flooding, strong winds and heavy rain...Joint Commonwealth-State disaster recovery funding was made available for counter disaster operations and the restoration of essential public assets in the QLD LGAs of Brisbane City, Gold Coast, Goondiwindi, Logan, Scenic Rim, Somerset, South Burnett, Southern Downs, Toowoomba and Western Downs following the February rainfall and floods.",This incident was included in the Major Incidents Report 2019-20 (AIDR 2020).

CycTiffany-Jan22,Flood - Severe Flooding from (ex) Tropical Cyclone Tiffany ,South Australia,South Australia,Flood,2022-01-21,2022-02-03,,,,https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/flood-severe-flooding-from-ex-tropical-cyclone-tiffany-south-australia-2022/,"A weather pattern influenced by ex-TC Tiffany, commencing early on 21 January and continuing until 3 February, resulted in record rainfall and flooding particularly in the north and west of South Australia. The flooding caused significant impacts on infrastructure, supply-chains, community, health and agricultural in northern, central, and western parts of the state..On 20 January, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding across central and northern parts of the South Australia. Early on 21 January heavy rainfall began to fall on the western Eyre Peninsula with flooding and widespread damage reported...Isolated thunderstorms continued for the next few days. Early the following week an upper low-pressure system and associated surface trough developed. There was an intensification of rainfall across the northwest of the state which moved slowly southwards to the northern parts of the Eyre Peninsula (including Kimba and Tarcoola) and eastwards to western Northeast Pastoral and Flinders. Much of the Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula and southern parts of the Pastoral districts recorded more than five times their January average rainfall...As the control agency for flooding and severe weather, the South Australia State Emergency Service (SASES) was responsible for the control of the response to the emergency. The SASES State Control Centre (SCC) was activated on 21 January and on 28 January, supported by liaison officers from several agencies and functional support groups. The SCC remained activated for 17 days and a Major Emergency Declaration was signed by the State Coordinator, lasting for 14 days. Two SASES regional coordination centres were also activated...Major damage was caused in 45 municipalities, the most extensive on the Eyre Peninsula and in the Northwest Pastoral area, including major disruptions to road and rail networks connecting the state to Western Australia and the Northern Territory...The area of impact is comprised of vast empty space and farming land, low population including some isolated and vulnerable populations, mining and pastoral communities. The response was very complex due to the distances involved, lack of government resources in remote areas, reliance on private operators, access and remoteness making assessment of damage very difficult, large areas remaining under water for a protracted period and the overlay of the COVID-19 pandemic...Damage, particularly to road and rail infrastructure, was arguably the most significant impact of the event, leading to critical consequences. Numerous highways, outback roads and tracks were closed due to flooding. The closure on 25 January of the Stuart Highway north of Glendambo, with large sections under water, had the most significant impact. The highway remained closed until 6 February, with a restricted reopening starting with essential heavy freight vehicles and emergency services. The highway was covered by approximately half a metre of water in some areas. The flood water at Glendambo was contained by high terrain, a ‘natural bowl’, and water levels were only dropping 40 mm per day. It was estimated that it would be 12 days minimum for restoration due to the time needed for water levels to subside, without human intervention such as high-volume pumping...The feasibility of escorted heavy fleet along the closed Stuart Highway was assessed, however there were concerns about further damage to the road surface, which was already weakened and soft in places from inundation. An alternative Type II Network Route (for B Triples) was assessed for road transport to Darwin by the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator (NHVR). This route extended from Burra to Broken Hill, Bourke, Mount Isa and Darwin. The NHVR sought urgent approvals from South Australia and New South Wales to gazette the route, which was approved for a 28-day period for transporting essential foods and designated transport providers...The route largely consisted of Type II approved roads and allowed road freight into Darwin and south to Alice Springs/ Coober Pedy, but the trip added two days of driving each way. By 30 January the new heavy vehicle route had been compromised with floodwaters near Camooweal on the Queensland-Northern Territory border. Trucks continued to travel through shallow floodwaters over the road, whilst the NHVR investigated alternative options...The east-west and north-south rail from Adelaide was closed for 24 days due to damage east of Tarcoola (18 washaway sites over 300 km) interrupting supply to both the Northern Territory and Western Australia. In excess of 50 return freight train trips (1.5 km long of rolling stock) normally move each week to Perth for one operator alone. The Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) restored the rail line by 15 February..Rail operators, One Rail Australia and Pacific Nation, collaborated to establish a land bridge from Port Adelaide and Alice Springs to Whyalla and Whyalla to Kalgoorlie, to manage a small proportion (5%) of the freight that would otherwise have been shipped via rail...Consequences of the road and rail impacts were far-reaching. Supply chain disruption had significant flow-on effects to communities and to the economy. Food security was significantly impacted in the north of South Australia and in the Northern Territory, and to a lesser extent in Western Australia...Water security was also impacted as the majority of Australia’s Alum (used in potable water and wastewater treatment) and other water treatment coagulants are sourced from Western Australia and supplied via rail. Disruption to the east-west supply route had significant implications for the eastern seaboard states and South Australia. South Australia Water reported that it generally utilises approximately 160 tonnes of coagulant per week and needed resupply within seven days before contingencies needed to be implemented. Options for contingencies included the use of the desalination plant at Port Stanvac, use of the reserve supply in South Australia, potential procurement of supply from New Zealand or India and alternative treatment options and reduction in water and wastewater treatment...Potential and realised health consequences included sickness associated with mosquitoes from standing water, delays to medical supply deliveries and flood damaged airstrips compromising Royal Flying Doctor Service flights in and out of remote sites for emergencies and scheduled clinics...Several tourists were stranded at Coober Pedy as well as Indigenous people seeking to return to Country (APY.Lands). Of the stranded travellers, some had urgent medical appointments in Adelaide and were evacuated from Coober Pedy by the Royal Australian Air Force to the Edinburgh air base on a return food resupply flight...Concerns for agriculture and animal welfare included the ability for pastoralists to provide access to shearers to enable them to shear sheep. February and March is shearing season and with so much water in the landscape the potential for large numbers of flies was high. The Department of Primary Industries and Regions (PIRSA) received requests for assistance from veterinarians and livestock owners to access properties in order to prevent and control blowfly strike in sheep...PIRSA also reported the Dog Fence (built to keep dingoes out and runs 5,614 km from Darling Downs in Queensland to just above the Great Australian Bight on the Nullarbor Plain in South Australia) sustained considerable damage with 20 km of damage identified. Dogs had been confirmed as trespassing and baiting options were considered and implemented. PIRSA also had concerns regarding topsoil movement and loss on Eyre Peninsula with potential impacts on future grain yields...The Department of Energy and Mines reported delays in mineral exports including iron ore, meaning deferred royalties into Treasury, and subsequent budget impacts. On 29 January it was reported that alternate transport routes were being explored. Simec Mining (Middleback Ranges) looked to truck approximately 2,000 tonnes of iron ore daily, with approximately 11 trucks operating seven days per week on a 12-hour basisfrom 7am to 7pm, for two weeks to Whyalla whilst rail infrastructure repairs occurred...At the strategic level, the emergency response was supported by the South Australia State Emergency Centre (SEC) and working groups including the Water Security Working Group, the SEC Supply Chain Consequence Management Group, and the SEC Remote Communities Food and Supply Group. The State Recovery Coordination and Planning Group was established and developed a recovery plan and funding submission to the Australian Government for funding under Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements...At the federal level, support was provided through the National Coordination Mechanism (NCM) which involved representatives of the transport sector and retail food suppliers. The NCM met with Trusted Information Sharing Network industry representatives seeking information on any industry specific supply chain issues...Through the NCM there was a coordinated industry approach to support supply chain challenges across Australia. The NCM engaged directly with industry, rail owners and operators, Australian Government departments, state and territory governments, and other related peak bodies to keep essential supplies moving and repair infrastructure as soon as possible...Just-in-time regulations were facilitated to limit the application of anti-competition laws allowing collaboration/cooperation between industry competitors. The benefits of this forum were substantial and there is merit in South Australia considering the options for a domestic coordination capability for large scale events in the state...The Australian Government National Situation Room monitored the situation across central and eastern Australia and coordinated imagery, forecasting and other support to the NCM. The Australian Defence Force also provided significant support under Defence Assistance to the Civil Community arrangements for resupplying food to Coober Pedy which had been cut off from usual supply routes and other taskings. Response to the severe weather and flooding event in South Australia and its impacts and consequences was wide-ranging. It involved the SASES, many South Australian government departments and NGOs, the Australian Government, commercial entities and infrastructure agencies. Given the unprecedented extent and scale of the impacts, there was a need for agencies to collaborate and innovate to support the community and minimise impacts.",This incident was included in the Major Incidents Report 2021-22 (AIDR 2022).

River systems from the Queensland border to the south coast as well as inland areas flooded. In some areas, flooding was to a scale that had never been seen before. The Wilsons River at Lismore reached a height of 14.4 m, which is 2m above previous records.The flooding was large scale and difficult to predict. For example, two days before the Wilsons River reached 14.4 m, the Bureau of Meteorology had forecast minor to moderate flooding. In over 50 days of flood operations, New South Wales State Emergency Service (NSW SES) responded to 33,421 requests for assistance, including more than 2,200 flood rescue activations. Tragically, 13 lives were lost and 4,055 properties were deemed uninhabitable as a result of flooding. Over 5,600 members of the NSW SES responded to the event, supported by interagency, interstate and Australian Defence Force resources..In March, the New South Wales Government commissioned an independent expert inquiry into the preparation for, causes of, response to and recovery from the catastrophic flood event across the state..Situation/Weather Systems .Leading into 2022, many catchments in New South Wales were full and soils were saturated. This was due to a La Niña event in March 2021 that led to widespread flooding. The Bureau of Meteorology declared a second La Niña Event for Australia in September. Commencing in November, NSW SES responded to 109 consecutive days of flooding in large parts of western New South Wales resulting from rain in northwest New South Wales and inland Queensland..From 22 February, a low-pressure system across northern NSW and southern Queensland produced heavy to torrential rainfall over the NSW coastline. This was followed by two more weeks of persistent coastal rainfall, including the development of two East Coast Lows (ECL), leading to flash and riverine flooding in numerous locations..The heavy rainfall began in southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales during the last week of February and continued further south into eastern New South Wales in March. Multi-day rainfall records were broken across south east Queensland and north east New South Wales, with multiple sites recording over 1 m (1,000 mm) of rainfall (Figure 21). For the last week of February, rainfall across parts of the region was at least 2.5 times the February average, with some parts experiencing more than 5 times the average. For north east New South Wales this was the wettest week since 1900. More than 50 locations in south east Queensland and north east New South Wales recorded more than 1 m of rain in the week ending 1 March..In the first week of March, the rainfall system shifted south along the New South Wales coast, bringing further heavy rainfall to eastern parts of the state. The Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment recorded its wettest 9-day period on record to 9 March (Figure 22)..Flooding.The intense and sustained rainfall across the region led to flash flooding and riverine flooding extending from Maryborough in Queensland to Grafton in New South Wales. Many of these communities also experienced flooding in 2021. With multiple weather systems impacting the state, some communities experienced two floods between February and April..Multiple communities in the Northern Rivers area experienced unprecedented flooding, with records broken by considerable margins. Devastating flooding occurred in Lismore, which experienced two floods in the space of a few weeks. The levee at Lismore overtopped both times, inundating the town on each occasion. The township of Woodburn was also inundated. Other towns experiencing significant flooding were Coraki,.Murwillumbah and Tumbulgum..In the Northern Rivers area several rivers reached a peak record height:.Wilsons River in Lismore peaked at a height over 14.4 m, which is 2.12 m above the previous record set in 1890.Tweed River in Murwillumbah peaked at 6.51 m, which is 0.31 m higher than the previous record set in 2017.Tweed River in Tumbulgum peaked at 4.77 m, which is 0.86 m higher than the previous record set in 2017.Richmond River in Casino peaked at 16.49 m, which is 0.28 m higher than the previous record set in 2008.Richmond River in Coraki peaked at 7.65 m, which is 0.64 m higher than previous record set in 1974.Richmond River in the Bungawalyn Junction peaked at 23 m, which is 1.48 m higher than the previous record set in 1974.Richmond River in Woodburn peaked at 7.17 m which is almost 1.8 m higher than the previous record set in 1954.Brunswick River in Mullumbimby peaked at 4.98 m which is 0.30 m higher than the previous record set in 1987.At the outset of this weather system the Warragamba Dam, Sydney’s main water storage, was already at 98%. The heavy rain and spilling from the dam resulted in moderate to major flooding along the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system. With the ongoing rain over a number of weeks some areas experienced two peaks during the one flood. The 2022 flood levels on this river system exceeded those of March 2021 and were comparable to those of 1978. The Nepean River at Menangle Bridge peaked at 15.92 m, more than 3 m higher than March 2021. The Hawkesbury River at Windsor peaked at 13.8 m, nearly 1 m above the March 2021 level; while at Portland it peaked at 8.64 m, almost 1 m above the 2021, 1978 and 1964 flood levels..During the same period, moderate to major flooding also occurred in the central and north coast areas of the state, including the Manning, Macleay, and Hunter rivers. Major flooding on the Hunter River at Singleton peaked at 13.15 m, exceeding March 2021 flood levels by nearly 1 m..Response activities and resources .With the scale of the weather events and associated flooding, multiple areas of operations and Incident Management Teams (IMTs) were established to coordinate response activities. The State Command Centre was also activated to facilitate resourcing, planning, intelligence, and public information in support of the IMTs. The State Emergency Operations Centre and various other emergency operations centres were also operating..Over 50 days of flood operations, the NSW SES responded to 33,421 requests for assistance, including over 2,200 flood rescue activations. More than 72,000 calls were received at the State Operations Centre. More than 5,600 members of the NSW SES (staff and volunteers) responded to the event. This equates to over 489,000 personnel hours..Communication with the public was a critical element of the NSW SES role during the floods. NSW SES issued over 500 evacuation related products and over 1,500 flood bulletins. The NSW SES webpage was visited 3.75 million times and the NSW SES Facebook page reached over four million people.NSW SES was supported in response efforts by personnel from NSW Rural Fire Service, Fire and Rescue NSW, NSW Ambulance, NSW Volunteer Rescue Association, NSW Police Force, National Parks and Wildlife Service, Marine Rescue NSW, Surf Life Saving NSW, Service NSW, and Resilience NSW..Over 785 personnel were sourced through the AFAC National Resource Sharing Centre to assist with flood operations in NSW. Assistance was provided from every state and territory. The Australian Defence Force supported response activities at a local level through Defence Assistance to the Civilian Community Level 1 (DACC1); and with wider support through DACC 2 requests. Support included aviation assets, high clearance vehicles and personnel..Impact on communities .The flooding significantly impacted multiple local government areas along the east coast of NSW, including Ballina, Kyogle, Bellingen, Lismore, Byron, Richmond Valley, Clarence Valley, Tweed, Singleton, Central Coast, Upper Hunter, Maitland, Port Stephens, Northern Beaches, Sutherland, Liverpool, Penrith, Fairfield, Hawkesbury, Canterbury Bankstown, Georges River, Bayside, Hornsby, Camden, Blacktown, The Hills, Wollondilly, Wollongong, and Shellharbour. Multiple communities in the Northern Rivers area experienced unprecedented flooding, with Lismore being one of the most heavily impacted communities. The township of Woodburn was also inundated..During the Lismore flooding on 28 February, there were 2,823 properties impacted by flood waters. This resulted in 1,900 requests for assistance to NSW SES, including 862 flood rescue activations. Many flood rescues were carried out by the “Tinny Army” – the local community providing assistance to fellow residents..All flooded communities experienced power and telecommunication outages, some lasting several days. Significant damage was caused to roads and other infrastructure in flooded communities across the state. For many residents and local governments, repairs for the damage that occurred as a result of the 2021 floods had only recently been completed. The second round of flooding in late March impacted many residents who had just completed the clean up from the flooding earlier in the month..The 2022 flooding event tragically claimed the lives of 13 people. This included one person on the Central Coast, six people in the Northern Rivers area, four people in the Sydney area, one person in Broken Hill and one person near Grafton. 21,170 properties were impacted by the flooding. Of these, 8,108 were inundated, 10,849 damaged and 4,055 assessed as uninhabitable..Relief and Recovery .Natural Disaster Declarations were made by the New South Wales Government for 62 local government areas impacted by flooding. This provided affected communities and individuals with a range of special assistance measures including access to financial assistance..The Australian Defence Force provided a range of support services to the response and relief effort, assisting with damage assessments, helping householders and property owners to commence the recovery effort by cleaning out homes and businesses and moving debris in many locations..Recovery centres were established in numerous communities. These centres provide residents with face-to-face access to a range of government services, support, and advice to assist with recovery from the flooding..In early March 2022, the New South Wales Government appointed New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Mal Lanyon as Northern New South Wales Recovery Coordinator to coordinate the large-scale multi-agency clean up and recovery processes required to assist the many communities impacted by the unprecedented flooding in the Northern Rivers area..On 1 June the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) estimated that the catastrophic flooding that devastated southeast Queensland and northern NSW was the fourth most expensive disaster in Australia’s history, with a total cost of $4.3 billion. However, the ICA estimated that the actual damage bill was likely to be significantly higher, with many residents not insured due to the cost of flood cover..Lismore City Council, in its own report of the floods, estimated more than $350 million worth of damage to council assets, with a repair bill for roads and bridges alone of $200 million. The report indicated that the cost of rebuilding the broader community would be close to $1 billion..Observations.NSW SES has recorded a number of initial observations following these flood events:.Partnering with other agencies and organisations is essential to joint preparedness and interoperability.As the complexity and frequency of severe weather events grow, the NSW SES preparedness and response capacity will also need to grow, as will the support to NSW SES volunteers.For NSW SES to prepare for the future, it is essential that the service has fit-for-purpose equipment and modern technology, and that partners’ assets, such as gauges, are also maintained.Further learnings will be identified through the extensive after action review program being completed and the independent inquiry into the floods commissioned by the New South Wales Government.. [https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/flood-rainfall-and-flooding-queensland-february-march-2022/] The Bureau of Meteorology forecasts for the 2021-22 storm and cyclone season indicated an increased chance of rain and widespread flooding, coastal flooding and erosion. Prior to the season, the Bureau of Meteorology modelling and evidence of cooling in the tropical Pacific Ocean raised the chance of a La Niña weather system forming in 2021. On 23 November, the Bureau of Meteorology declared that a La Niña weather system had developed in the Pacific Ocean.The South East Queensland (SEQ) flood event was caused by a low pressure system over Queensland’s southern coast that dragged moisture from the Coral Sea in the north. From 22 February to 7 March, the Brisbane, Maryborough, Gympie, Sunshine Coast, Caboolture, Toowoomba, Ipswich, Logan and Gold Coast areas suffered major flooding as a result of intense rainfall which led to flash flooding and riverine flooding across large areas of South East Queensland..Resourcing .Disaster management in Queensland requires local, district and state groups, government agencies and non-government organisations to work effectively together under Queensland’s disaster management arrangements. The multiple stakeholders have a range of diverse and significant responsibilities and the capacity and effectiveness of the system and its functioning is dependent on continuous maintenance of these relationships and associated functions..During the SEQ flood event, a total of 23 local disaster management groups (LDMGs) and eight district disaster management groups (DDMGs) were activated, with Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) regional operational centres established in each of the impacted regions. The intensity and extended duration of the event resulted in a total of 1,623 State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers delivering and supporting emergency services activities which totalled over 36,200 hours of effort. The main focus of that effort was directed towards temporary repairs, sandbagging and flood boat operations. Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) swift water teams were also heavily involved in the event and in total, over 8,100 tasks were completed by QFES personnel..A coordinated effort across the arrangements was maintained with effective online and in-person communications via online updates and daily briefings and debriefings. The inclusion of QFES emergency management coordinators and liaison officers was critical in supporting the coordinated effort from LDMGs and DDMGs to QFES incident command. This created the ability to extend situational awareness and communication which, in turn, supported an efficient and coordinated response to what was a large scale event..The SEQ flood event evolved rapidly and placed considerable and complex demands on emergency services over a sustained period. From 24 -27 February, Wivenhoe Dam capacity rose from 58.7% to 183.9%. Peak flooding occurred from 25-27 February and the Bureau of Meteorology map issued on 27 February, five days into the event, provides an appreciation for the scale and areas impacted. Rainfall totals for the 6 days ending on 28 February were at least 2.5 times the February average rainfallacross the South East Queensland area, with some parts of Queensland receiving more than 5 times their monthly average rainfall for February..In response, FRS motorised swift water rescue teams were deployed throughout affected regions, supported by SES flood boat crews, who worked in collaboration with Queensland Police Service and Surf Life Saving Queensland personnel.
